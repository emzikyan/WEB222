    <h1 id="title">History of Soccer</h1>

    <p id="paragr1">
      Soccer, also known as football, has a long and
      rich history that dates back thousands of years.
      Old Mesoamerican tribes produced the earliest 
      recorded instances of team games
      utilizing a ball formed of a rock more than
      3,000 years ago. Although there were several
      variations of the game played throughout a wide
      area, it was created by the Aztecs and was named 
      Tchatali. The ball may represent the sun on 
      certain ritual occasions, and the losing team's
      captain might be offered as a sacrifice to the 
      gods. A rubber-made bouncing ball was a distinctive
      aspect of Mesoamerican forms of ball games; no other 
      early civilization had access to rubber. <br><br>
      The first documented kick-and-ball game, known 
      as cuju, was played in China during the third 
      and second centuries BC. Cuju was played on a 
      square-shaped space with a circular ball made 
      of stitched leather with fur or feathers inside.
      Later, a modified version of this game known as 
      kemari was played in ceremonial settings and 
      spread to Japan. <br><br>
      Other types of ball games have existed since
      the time of Ancient Greece. The ball was created
      using hair-filled leather slivers. 
      (the first documents of balls filled with air
      are from the 7th century). However, ball
      games were considered low status and were 
      excluded from the Panhellenic Games.
      Games using balls did not take place during 
      entertainment in the large arenas 
      (amphitheaters) of Ancient Rome, but rather
      during military drills known as Harpastum. 
      Football was introduced to the 
      British Isles by the Romans. (Britannica).
      However, it is unclear to what extent
      the British population was inspired by 
      this type and to what extent they had 
      created their own variations. <br><br>
      In England, a game known as "mob football" 
      was well-liked throughout the Middle Ages. 
      Each team had a sizable number of people, 
      and the game's ball was manufactured out of 
      animal bladders. The goal was to get the ball to 
      a certain spot, such a city gate or a cathedral.
      Early in the nineteenth century, English colleges 
      and universities started to create their own 
      versions of football. The rules varied 
      significantly from location to location, but 
      as several organizations started to develop, 
      the game became more standardized. <br><br>
      The Football Association (FA) was founded in 
      England in 1863 with the goal of developing a 
      uniform set of regulations for the sport. 
      These regulations established the corner kick, 
      the penalty kick, and forbade the use of hands 
      and arms (apart from by the custodian). 
      The FA's regulations were swiftly embraced by 
      other nations, and football started to take off 
      globally. <br><br>
      Between Scotland and England, the first 
      international soccer game was played in 1872. 
      With the exception of 1942 and 1946 due to 
      World War II, the World Cup has been staged 
      every four years since its inaugural event in 1930.
      <br><br>
      Today, soccer is the most popular sport in the 
      world, with an estimated 3.5 billion fans. 
      It is played at all levels, from amateur to 
      professional, and it continues to evolve as new 
      strategies and techniques are developed.
